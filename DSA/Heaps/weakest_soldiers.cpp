/*
This program finds the k weakest rows in a binary matrix based on the number of soldiers.
A soldier is represented by 1 and a civilian by 0.
The weakness of a row is determined first by the number of soldiers (ascending order),
and if thereâ€™s a tie, the row with the smaller index is considered weaker.

Algorithm:
1. For each row in the matrix:
   - Count the number of soldiers (1's).
   - Store the count along with the row index in a `row` object.
2. Push all `row` objects into a min-priority queue (`priority_queue` with custom comparator).
   - Comparator ensures rows are sorted by soldier count first, then by index.
3. Pop the top k elements from the priority queue and print their indices.
   - These correspond to the k weakest rows.

Example:
Input:
matrix = {
    {1,0,0,0},
    {1,1,1,1},
    {1,0,0,0},
    {1,0,0,0}
}
k = 2
Output:
0 2
Explanation: Row 0 and Row 2 have the fewest soldiers and are weaker than others.
