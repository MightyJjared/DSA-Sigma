/*
here inside the nested loop we have copy pasted and did one additional change ie in dp[][prev] we have done 
dp[][prev+1] as we cant store -1 index in array
also in the nested loop the 2 loop is going backwards ie from index-1 to -1 we can do reevrse also ie from -1
index-1 and chnage nothing else inside or outside it and it will still work
// also in base case since we are returning 0and here the dp is initialized as 0 no need to write the basecase

ðŸ”¹ LeetCode Reference: 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
ðŸ”¹ Problem Explanation:
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

Example:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
