Important in memo i was going from 1 to m so opposite here and j was going from m to 1 so opposite
but think logically and acocrding to base case j will always be greater or equal to i so we willstart j from 
i instead of 1
and also if you see here int cut = cuts[j+1] - cuts[i-1] 
                            + dp[i][k-1]
                            + dp[k+1][j];
in last it is saying dp[k+1] ie if i = m it is going m+1 but our vector we declared was m+1 so if we compute
dp[k+1] ie m+1 it will go out of bounds so declare the 2d vector as m+2 instead of m +1

ðŸ”¹ LeetCode Reference: 1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick
---------------------------------------------------------
Given a stick of length `n` and an array `cuts` where cuts[i] denotes a position to cut the stick. 
The cost of a cut is equal to the length of the stick being cut. Return the minimum total cost 
to cut the stick into pieces.
