LeetCode Reference: 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/

Question:
--------------------------------
You are given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] 
represents a point on the 2D plane. The cost of connecting two points 
[xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the Manhattan distance between them:
    cost = |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|

We need to connect all points such that the total cost is minimized. 
The result should be the weight (sum of costs) of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

--------------------------------
Approach (Prim's Algorithm for MST):
1. Treat each point as a vertex in a graph. 
2. The weight of an edge between two vertices (points) is their Manhattan distance.
3. Use Primâ€™s Algorithm:
   - Start from any node (here, 0).
   - Use a Min-Heap (priority_queue with greater comparator) to always pick 
     the smallest edge that connects a new vertex to the MST.
   - Keep adding edges until all points are included in the MST.
4. The sum of these selected edges = minimum cost to connect all points.

--------------------------------
Time Complexity:
- Each insertion into the priority queue is O(log V).
- For each node, we may push up to O(V) edges into the priority queue.
- So, worst case complexity = O(V^2 log V).

--------------------------------
