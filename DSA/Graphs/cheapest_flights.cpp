// also  by using this condition current.stops + 1 <= k even if there is a cycle and we are not using visited concept
// beacuse of this condition even if cycle is there we wont add it or we wont go there
// also (u) here is current node or vertex
// also in the dijkstras for edge relaxation we use condition (dist[v] > dist[u] + wt) but here it is important
// we use (dist[v] > current.cost + wt), ie cost intead of dist[u] as here this time we also have stops or k limitation

    LeetCode Reference: 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
    --------------------------------------------------------
    Question:
    You are given:
      - n cities (labeled from 0 to n-1).
      - an array flights where flights[i] = [u, v, w] 
        means there is a flight from city u to city v with cost w.
      - integers src (source city), dst (destination city), and k (maximum allowed stops).

    You need to find the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops.
    If no such route exists, return -1.

    Key Points:
    - "At most k stops" means the path can use up to k+1 edges (flights).
    - Edge weights (flight costs) are positive.
    - The problem is basically "shortest path with a constraint on number of stops".

    Approach in this code (BFS-like traversal):
    --------------------------------------------
    - We define a class 'info' to keep track of:
         u     -> current city
         cost  -> total cost so far
         stops -> how many stops we have taken so far
    - We use a queue (BFS style) to explore neighbors level by level (stops-wise).
    - For each popped node, we check all outgoing flights:
         if going to a neighbor gives a cheaper cost and doesn't exceed k stops,
         we update distance and push that neighbor into the queue.
    - Finally, we check dist[dst]. If it is still INT_MAX, no path exists.

    Why BFS works here:
    - Since we are limiting by number of stops (levels), BFS ensures
      we do not explore paths longer than allowed stops.
    - We still maintain a 'dist' array to ensure we only relax when
      we find a strictly cheaper path.

    Time Complexity:
    - O(V * E) in the worst case, since each edge can be relaxed multiple times.
    - Acceptable for typical constraints in this problem.
